# 👥 HR Employee Attrition Dashboard in Power BI

This is my second Power BI project, where I explored and visualized HR data to better understand employee attrition patterns. The dataset comes from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), and the goal was to analyze key factors behind attrition such as job satisfaction, environment, department, age, and years at company.

The purpose of this project was to deepen my knowledge of Power BI by working with real-world HR data and building a professional dashboard that can help HR departments make informed decisions.
